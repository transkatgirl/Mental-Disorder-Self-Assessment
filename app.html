			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This application uses existing self-report mental health assessment questionnaires that have been
				assessed
				for adequate reliability and validity. However, unlike clinical
				tools that provide the results from these questionnaires to the
				mental health professional
				assessing the individual, this application allows the individual taking the questionnaire to assess
				their
				own results.
			</p>
			<p>Allowing individuals to have a better understanding of their own mental health can empower them to make
				informed
				decisions regarding their mental health care, and <em>could greatly assist</em> those with limited
				access to
				psychiatric
				services. Although self-report assessments of mental-health have notable limitations (listed below),
				there
				still exists
				evidence (see references section) that there is potential for them to provide useful information with
				limited bias.
			</p>
			<p>Combining information from multiple sources to maximize the depth and breadth of information available
				can
				result in a more accurate picture of an individual's mental health. The results of self-assessments only
				represent
				one possible source; it is up to the user to fit them into the bigger picture.</p>

			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Self-report questionnaires contain some inherit limitations in their validity. Individuals can skew
				their results by exaggerating or under-reporting their symptoms, and can make errors (such as
				misinterpreting a question or misremembering relevant information) that meaningfully
				influence the
				final results. This application does not attempt to assess indicators of potential response
				biases.</p>
			<p><strong>Knowledge of assessment contents can influence how individuals respond to them in the
					future. This application uses clinical assessments outside of a clinical setting, which may bias
					future
					responses to psychological tests.</strong> Although this application does make some attempts to
				prevent
				the individual from <em>accidentally</em> biasing their results, repeated use of the questionnaire and
				knowledge of the
				questionnaire's scoring may bias subsequent responses.</p>
			<p>Although the questionnaires used in this application have undergone some validation and are not limited
				to a
				specific clinical subpopulation, they may still contain
				flaws that limit their reliability and validity. Known limitations of the assessments used will be
				displayed
				on the results page.
			</p>
			<p>The
				current version
				of this application is unable to
				assess symptoms of developmental disorders (such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder or Autism
				Spectrum
				Disorder) or substance use disorders. Measures related to these disorders may be added in a future
				version.
			</p>
			<p><strong>This application is a proof-of-concept and has not been validated for usefulness, accuracy or
					correctness. This application should be used for educational purposes only and
					is not a substitute for a diagnosis from a mental health professional. Clinical training is
					required to make
					a clinically useful
					diagnosis</strong>, as it is difficult to determine the threshold where symptoms & traits become
				pathological.</p>


			<h2>Classifying Mental Disorders</h2>
			<p>Existing categorical classifications, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
				Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), have significant limitations.
				They contain significant symptom overlap between disorders, which leads to limited diagnostic
				reliability and frequent disorder
				co-occurence. They also enforce arbitrary boundaries between pathology and normality, while current
				evidence suggests that all mental disorders likely exist on a continuum.
			</p>
			<p>Addressing these limitations requires creating alternate non-categorical mental disorder classification
				models. However,
				this is currently an active area of research. Although promising
				research prototypes exist, none
				are
				currently
				used in widespread clinical practice.</p>
			<p>This application uses an alternate classification
				framework, based around a modified version of the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Taxonomy_of_Psychopathology">Hierarchical Taxonomy
					of Psychopathology (HiTOP)</a> model. Instead of
				discrete categories, the HiTOP model
				uses continuous dimensions of
				varying levels of specificity, organized hierarchically from narrowest to broadest.</p>
			<p>However, many aspects of the current HiTOP model are provisional or incomplete. In order to work around
				these limitations, stop-gap modifications were made to incorporate <em>preliminary</em> research (see
				references
				section). As work on these models progresses, these modifications will become unnecessary.</p>
