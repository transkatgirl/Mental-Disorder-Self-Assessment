		"In this survey, you will be asked to respond to a number of statements about your thoughts, feelings, and behavior. Some of these things are pretty common, whereas others are less common.",

		"Scores are reported as t-scores by default, which have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Statistically-based cutoffs (such as a t-score of 65-70 or greater) may be useful heuristics, but they should not be used in an inflexible manner. Low scores (such as a t-score below 40) are not always meaningful, and need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",
		"This scoring system makes the assumption that scores are normally distributed, and this assumption is often violated when evaluating pathological traits. If the scale is not normally distributed, then the t-scores may match up with either a higher or lower percentile, depending on how the distribution is skewed."
